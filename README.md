<h2> My favorite movie is Ace Ventura: Pet Detective </h2> Ace is a Miami-based private detective specializing in the retrieval of missing animals, the son of Rex Ventura and descendant of such as "Ernest Ventura Shackleton" and "Jacques Ventura Costeau". It is not known whether the animated television series was contiguous with the feature-films; but if it was it may take place before them because the only one of his pets to appear in the series is his capuchin monkey, Spike. His eccentricities make him a laughing stock to the Miami-Dade Police Department in the early part of the first movie, but he eventually earned their respect after his rescue of quarterback Dan Marino and the dolphin, Snowflake, the mascot of the Miami Dolphins. 

### Who is the main character in Ace Ventura: pet detective? 
Jim Carrey The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), Dumb and Dumber (1994) and The Mask (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor. 

### Favorite lines of the actor:
- “If I’m not back in five minutes… just wait longer.”
- “Lovely party. Pity I wasn’t invited.”
- “I gotta go guys! I gotta date with your mothers!”
- “It’s ALIVE. IT’S ALIVE.”
- “Aaall righty, then.”
